# Social Media Intelligencer

This is my final year project. It is an OSINT tool which is used to gather information about a person using single input like a keyword from different sources.

The project revolves around creating automated OSINT data gathering and analysis scripts and integrating them all into one toolkit which can create datasets.This project uses techniques like search engine dorking queries and other OSINT information gathering techniques to acquire data from the internet. Modules including social media post scrapers and public personal information scrapers, structure all the information into a dataset that is available to be saved as a CSV file or PDF report.
